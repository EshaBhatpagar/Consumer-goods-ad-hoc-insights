# consumer goods ad-hoc insights

## Introduction
Atliq Hardware, a global computer hardware company, specializes in selling computers and accessories. The companyâ€™s leadership identified a need for faster and more efficient access to business insights for better decision-making. To address this, they initiated an SQL-based challenge to assess potential junior data analysts on their problem-solving and technical skills.

## Business Problem
The management team needed quick responses to **10 ad hoc business queries** related to product performance, customer behavior, and financial metrics. The challenge involved retrieving relevant insights using structured queries on a provided database.

## Data Overview
The analysis was conducted using the **`gdb023` (atliq_hardware_db)** database, which consists of six key tables:
- **Customers (`dim_customer`)** â€“ Stores customer details.
- **Products (`dim_product`)** â€“ Contains product-related information.
- **Gross Price (`fact_gross_price`)** â€“ Provides details on product pricing.
- **Manufacturing Costs (`fact_manufacturing_cost`)** â€“ Tracks product production costs.
- **Pre-Invoice Deductions (`fact_pre_invoice_deductions`)** â€“ Lists deductions applied before invoicing.
- **Sales (`fact_sales_monthly`)** â€“ Holds monthly sales figures.

## Approach
### 1. Data Extraction
- **SQL Queries:** Developed optimized SQL queries using **MySQL** to extract necessary data efficiently.

### 2. Data Visualization
- **Power BI Dashboards:** Designed intuitive visual representations of insights for better comprehension.

### 3. Presentation
